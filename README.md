# Secret-Knock-Detector
A mechanism that opens a door when it hears the secret knock.

## Description
The project consists in Piezo Speaker that  listens to a knock and if you give it the "secret knock" the Servo Motor will open the door. We also have some Led Lights for feedback and a Button to program a new "secret knock". The project is made from a tutorial with some changes regardin the construction part. For full suport in the software and electronics part, I highly recomend checking the link at the "Credit" section. In the following lines I will describe the changes that I made for my project.

## Materials

Electronics:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 Servo Motor
* 1 Piezo Speaker
* 1 Normal Pushbutton
* 1 Red Led
* 1 Green Led
* 1 Blue Led
* 1 Transistor P2N2222A
* 1 Rectifier Diode (1N4001 or similar)
* 1 2.2k ohm resistor
* 1 10k ohm resistor
* 1 1M ohm resistor
* 2 560 ohm resistor
* 1 piece of perf board
* 1 9 volt battery clip and 9v battery
*  Wires

Case:
* 1 Cheap Mailbox
* 1 Door Latche

Tools:
* Drill
* Safety glasses and gloves
* Hot Glue or Duct Tape

## Installing
The installation procces is pretty simple. Download the file, open it with Arduino IDE and uploade it to your Arduino Uno Board. If you want to follow a similar case construction, I suggest to use my code because I did some minor optimization to the sensitivity of the sensor.
