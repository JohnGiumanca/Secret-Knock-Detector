# Secret-Knock-Detector
A mechanism that opens a door when it hears the secret knock.

## Description
The project consists in Piezo Speaker that  listens to a knock and if you give it the "secret knock" the Servo Motor will open the door. We also have some Led Lights for feedback and a Button to program a new "secret knock".
